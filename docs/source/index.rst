Air-Child Payslip Documentation
===============================

This documentation is primarily a source for developers contributing to The Air-Child Payslip project and administrators
maintaining it. Furthermore, also specific functionality for end users exclusively provided by Payslip (such as payroll
management) will find a certain level of coverage by this documentation. However, this documentation does not cover
general `FSEconomy`_ end user guidance.

.. _FSEconomy: http://www.fseconomy.net/

.. note::

   This documentation is perpetually updated from the project's central :ref:`git repository's <blessed-repository>`
   master branch. To ensure you work with the latest version available, please make sure to access this documentation
   exclusively at https://air-child.github.io/payslip/


How the documentation is organised
----------------------------------

* If you're a Payroll Manager, FSEconomy Group Staff Member, FSE pilot, or assuming any other role linked to Air-Child's
  FSEconomy group, try the :doc:`User's Guide <user/index>`.

* If you're a Payslip administrator, try the technical :doc:`Administrator's Guide <admin/index>` -- this
  might just be the documentation you're looking for.

* Looking for information on a specific application being part of Air-Child Payslip? Check out the
  :doc:`Application Section <applications/index>`, providing information on all applications written for Payslip.

* The :doc:`Project Documentation <internals/index>` will tell you about the development process, and how you can
  contribute.

* :doc:`Reference guides <ref/index>` contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of the Air-Child Payslip
  machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have `Python`_ and `Django`_ knowledge.
